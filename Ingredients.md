Cocoa Powder: The most important ingredient contributing to the flavor of the eggless chocolate cake is cocoa powder. It is important to use a good quality, naturally processed cocoa powder as this will affect the overall taste and consistency of the cake.
Whole Wheat Flour: The choice of healthy whole wheat flour will provide an almost nutty flavor in the cake. 
Baking Soda: The most important ingredient affecting the texture of the cake is the baking soda, so it is important that it is fresh. If the baking soda is not fresh or is past its shelf life, the cake will not rise.
Lemon Juice: The lemon juice is also crucial in causing the vegan chocolate cake to rise properly. However, if you donâ€™t have lemon juice, white vinegar or apple cider vinegar can be used for the same effect.
Oil: Use oil which has neutral flavors for the best result.Oil also helps in making the cake soft and moist.
Flavorings: Vanilla powder can be added instead of vanilla extract. You can even add vanilla essence instead of vanilla extract.
Liquids: The only liquid I have added to the cake batter is water. Milk (dairy or vegan milks like almond milk, cashew milk or soy milk) can be added instead of water. 
Sweeteners: For the sweeteners, you can opt to use raw sugar (like I have done) or swap in white sugar or brown sugar.
