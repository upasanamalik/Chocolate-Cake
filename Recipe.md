First grease a round baking pan of 7.5 inches diameter x 2 inches height with oil. Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit) for 15 minutes.
Sieve 1 cup whole wheat flour (you can also use all-purpose flour) and 3 tablespoons cocoa powder. Keep a plate or tray below the sieve.
Add a pinch of salt and ½ teaspoon baking soda.
Sift the ingredients on to a plate.
Keep the sieved dry ingredients aside.
 In another pan or bowl, add ¾ cup sugar. I have used raw, unrefined cane sugar, however regular white sugar can also be used. Add 1 cup  water. 
 Stir with a small whisk till the sugar dissolves.
Now add ¼ cup oil. 
Stir briskly so that everything is mixed well.
It should be a homogenous mixture.
 Next add 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Stir again.
 TIP: No lemon? No problem. We just need something acidic here. You could use 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar or white vinegar in place of lemon juice.
 Now add ½ teaspoon vanilla extract. Feel free to add chocolate extract or chocolate essence instead of vanilla.
 Mix very well.
 Add the sieved dry ingredients to the wet mixture.
 Using a wired whisk, mix everything well.
 There should be no lumps in the cake batter. The batter should also be slightly thin, not thick like a brownie batter.
 Pour the eggless chocolate cake batter into the prepared cake pan.
 Tap the sides so that the extra air bubbles are let out.
  Bake the eggless chocolate cake in a preheated oven for 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit) for 35 to 40 mins.
